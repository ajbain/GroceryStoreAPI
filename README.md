# GroceryStoreAPI

## Introduction:
The aim of this project was implement AGILE methodology, as well as team Git practices into an API application. Our team chose a Grocery Store API, making classes for Ingredients, Recipes, and Transactions. 
This project implements CRUD into our database creation, as well as testing endpoints of our APIs using Postman. We created a google sheet that included tickets/ user stories to help us understand the AGILE methodology more. 
We then assigned points to these user stories to figure out the effort and time commitment these tickets would take.
