# GroceryStoreAPI Team Happy

## Introduction:
The aim of this project was implement AGILE methodology, as well as team Git practices into an API application. Our team chose a Grocery Store API, making classes for Ingredients, Recipes, and Transactions. 

This project implements CRUD into our database creation, as well as testing endpoints of our APIs using Postman. We created a google sheet that included tickets/ user stories to help us understand the AGILE methodology more. Postman Port number 44326

We then assigned points to these user stories to figure out the effort and time commitment these tickets would take. this was done in a shared Google Doc you cn see at this URL. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hq0anjxkZPiXSHoJskFoaV_RJcUS15_oT-f6nk0hH6M/edit#gid=0

## Steps
We then Created a Trello board based off of this initial google doc plan that can be found at this URL https://trello.com/b/TzIG1oni/grocery-list you will need a trello account to view this borad and may need acces granted by our team, we are new to this and not entirely sure if those outside the team can view it.
